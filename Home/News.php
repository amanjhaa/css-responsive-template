        <h4>Indonesia quake deaths top 130, aid effort intensifies</h4>
        <p>
            Aid began reaching isolated areas of the Indonesian island struggling after
            a powerful earthquake that killed at least 131 people, while rescuers doubled
            down on efforts to find the dead.<br/>

            Volunteers and rescue personnel were erecting more temporary shelters for the
            tens of thousands of people left homeless on Lombok by the magnitude 7.0 quake
            on August 5. Water, food and medical supplies were being distributed from trucks.
            The military said five planes carrying food, medicine, blankets, field tents and
            water tankers left Jakarta for the island on August 8 morning.

        <p>
            Two common toilets for families living in 15 small rooms, waterlogged streets replete with animal
            excreta where utensils are also washed, over six persons sharing a 10x10 room and women bathing 
            in the same space where they cook food. Such are the living conditions where Mangal, his wife Bina
            and their three daughters Mansi (8), Shikha (4), and Parul (2) used to live before Saturday and
            after they shifted.<br/>

            Right opposite the room where the three minor girls died due to starvation on Tuesday, live Satyaveer
            (21) and his wife Sarita (20), who belong to Uttar Pradesh’s Kasganj.

        <h4>Oscar winner Robert Redford announces retirement from acting</h4>
        <p>
            Veteran Hollywood star Robert Redford has announced his retirement
            from acting, saying The Old Man & The Gun would be his last film.
            The 81-year-old star said he is making good on his 2016 promise
            about hanging his boots as an actor.<br/>

            “Never say never, but I pretty well concluded that this would be 
            it for me in terms of acting, and (I’ll) move towards retirement
            after this ‘cause I’ve been doing it since I was 21. I thought, Well,
            that’s enough. And why not go out with something that’s very upbeat
            and positive?” Redford said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly.
